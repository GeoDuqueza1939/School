Main/Base System:
* CASSY (Classroom and Administration Support System)
  > Hosts and provides a way to manage subsystems
  > Provides an interface to let users access extension functionality
  > Lets a user create and manage his/her user profile, which includes personal information, device information, and user preferences
  > Allows the system itself to send usability statistics (optional) and bug reports

Subsystems/Extensions:
* THEA (Task Helper and Assistant) - Task Organizer
  > Default subsystem
  > Allows users to create task items
  > Organizes task items according to categories, priorities, delegation, and scheduling
  > Affords task management features for managing the different stages of tasks (creation, delegation, termination, etc.)
  > Enables users to add organizers to each task item, such as checklists, steps/workflows, assigners, co-delegates
  
* PLATO (Lesson Planning Tool)
  > Allows users to create lesson plans according to specified formats
  > Provides different lesson plan views, such as DLP, DLL, Unit plan view, etc.
  > Interfaces with THEA to allow user to launch PLATO from a lesson-planning task item.
  > Allows sharing of lesson plans and exporting to different formats.
  > Allows easier copying of entries from other DLL's into the subsystem interface.

* CLARE (Class Record)
  > Allows recording of student scores.
  > Holds students' personal and academic information.
  > Provide different views of student information, including as a class masterlist and as a class record.
  > Allows sharing of student information and scores with other teachers through the app and this app subsystem.
  > Can be used to record different kinds of student related information as grades/scores,  health information (height, weight, inclusion in the SBFP), home visit information, 4P's and indigence, co-curricular and extra-curricular involvement, achievements (curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular)

* CORA (Class Organizer Assistant)

====================
Updates to Thesis.docx:
* modified the statement of the problem into a more simplified paragraph-based version
* adjusted the objectives of the study to correspond with the problem statement
* conceptual framework changed into the input-process-output form
* removed/edited items in the definition of terms
* synthesis paragraphs are marked with citations to make them easier to see
====================
tasks scheduling properties (to be used for automated scheduling)
* when to do
  * mandatory
  * optional/preferred
  * flexible, non-specific schedule (e.g., next week, in 2 weeks, etc.)
* when not to do
  * exact time/date schedule
  * regular/fixed schedule

schedules should be set for the following
* work-related tasks
* professional development-related tasks
* sleep/rests/vacations
* hobbies/leisure

Tasks, Projects, Appointments, and Meetings
* Tasks are done.
* Projects are planned and each step of the plan is executed.
* Meetings are regular or scheduled meetings with associates.
* Appointments are non-regular meetings with specific persons or groups.

possible applications for AI
* detect tasks that could either be non-essential or too routinary
  * advice user to remove them or place them on something akin to a daily routine checklist
* advise user on actions to take regarding commonly missed or postponed tasks
  * review list and modify when necessary
  * modify task schedule
* advise user on actions to take when activities are detected during supposed schedules for rest
* assist user in avoiding analysis paralysis
* identify task type based on typed text

tutorial for features
* notifications appear whenever features are used for the first time, with an option to show the notification on the next app session
* tutorial notifications can be disabled in the settings
  * enabled
  * enabled (first time only)
  * disabled
