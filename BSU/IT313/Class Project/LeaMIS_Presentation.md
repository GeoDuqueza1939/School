## Project Overview

## Problem Statement

- Manual processes prone to errors and non-compliance  
- Paper-only filing creates bulky documentation  
- Inefficient communication of leave credits  
- Time-consuming processing, hard to track status  
- Tedious updating of multiple leave credit types

   - File leaves & track status  
   - Check leave credit balances  
   - Print CS Form No. 6 with pre-filled signatories  
   - Print digitally approved & verifiable CS Form No. 6

## Objectives (2/2)

2. Easy-to-use UI for:  
   - Teachers & non-teaching personnel  
   - HR staff (processing & credit management)  
   - Managers (approval & policy drafting)

3. Automate leave-credit updates  
4. Streamline back-office processes  
5. Reduce paper-based transactions  
6. Offer semi-automation or full, paperless automation
